Hi %s,

We’re thrilled to welcome you to Locarie — a community designed to help you discover and connect with the places that you resonate with.

Locarie isn’t just an app; it’s a way to explore the personality and soul of physical spaces in the city, whether you're seeking a new favourite spot or looking to feel more connected to your surroundings.

With real-time updates directly from the people running these spaces, you’ll find curated recommendations that feel personal, relevant, and grounded.

To get started, simply explore the map, follow spaces that inspire, and watch your Locarie feed come to life!

Got questions or suggestions? We’d love to hear from you. Just reply to this email, or drop by the Feedback section in the app.

Welcome to a new way of experiencing the city.

Cheers,
The Locarie Team
